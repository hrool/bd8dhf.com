This is BD8DHF, an amateur radio enthusiast from Chengdu, Sichuan, China. Since 2023, I have been using this callsign for communication. 

I am also a DevOps engineer and an avid fan of outdoor activities such as cycling and mountaineering. In 2012, cycling over two thousand kilometers from Chengdu to Lhasa.
