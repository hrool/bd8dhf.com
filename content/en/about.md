This is BD8DHF, based in Chengdu, Sichuan, China. Since 2024, I primarily operate on the 15m, 12m, and 10m bands using FT8 mode.

Regarding log confirmations, I upload logs almost in real-time to [wavelog.bd8dhf.com](http://wavelog.bd8dhf.com) through GridTracker. I have a scheduled task set up to automatically synchronize logs to LOTW, QRZ, eQSL.cc, ClubLog, and HRDLOG.net within 12 hours. If you find that your log has not been confirmed for a long time, it might be due to incomplete QSO information. Please send me the relevant log, and once received, I will manually update the log immediately.

If you wish to exchange QSL cards, please send yours first, and I will promptly return a card upon receipt. To ensure the successful delivery of the paper QSL card, please include my mobile phone number after the recipient's address to facilitate postal delivery.
